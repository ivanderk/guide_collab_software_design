## PlantUML examples

The examples for the diagrams in the C4 Model can be found in the "src" directory. They are made with a [PlantUML extension](https://github.com/RicardoNiepel/C4-PlantUML). 

Check out [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) and how to use it in [Visual Studio Code](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1278703/UML-Made-Easy-with-PlantUML-VS-Code).
